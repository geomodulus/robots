# robots

Toolkit for building rich interactive, AI-enhanced publishing robots on the Geomodulus platform.

## Usage

This library requires node, npm and one specific JS library, `prettier`. Be sure to install it
from `package.json` using the following command:

```
 npm install
```

## Github support

One common goal of bots running on the Geomodulus platform is contributing to the various content 
repositories including [Corpus](/geomodulus/corpus) and [Places](/geomodulus/places). This can be
accomplished using the Github package.
